title: FRB 180725A
---

We have published today an item in The Astronomer's Telegram ([ATEL#11901])
announcing the first detection of fast radio bursts between 400 and 800 MHz by
CHIME/FRB.

> During its ongoing commissioning CHIME/FRB detected FRB 180725A on 2018 July
> 25 at 17:59:43.115 UTC (topocentric, at 400 MHz). The automated pipeline
> triggered the recording to disk of ~20 seconds of buffered raw intensity data
> around the time of the FRB. The event had an approximate width of 2 ms and was
> found at dispersion measure 716.6 pc/cm^3 with a signal-to-noise ratio S/N
> ~20.6 in one beam and 19.4 in a neighbouring beam. The centres of these,
> approximately 0.5 deg wide and circular beams, were at RA, Dec = (06:13:54.7,
> +67:04:00.1; J2000) and RA, Dec = (06:12:53.1, +67:03:59.1; J2000). However,
> precise localisation of the source and a flux estimate await further
> commissioning and calibration. The expected maximum Galactic line-of-sight
> dispersion measure in the source's direction is 69 pc/cm^3 (from the NE2001
> model) or 81 pc/cm^3 (from the YMW16 model). The observed DM is far in excess
> of these values, even after accounting for the systematic uncertainties in the
> Galactic-DM models, confirming the identification of this event as an FRB. The
> event is clearly detected at frequencies as low as 580 MHz and represents the
> first detection of an FRB at radio frequencies below 700 MHz.

It's a beauty:
