I am a software developer working on the Fast Radio Burst detection pipeline for
the Canadian Hydrogen Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope. I am primarily
responsible for computing infrastructure, metric collection, and monitoring, as
well as baseband data acquisition, and managing data product from their
acquisition to transport to our HPC centre.

Prior to joining CHIME, I worked as a scientific programmer in the Department of
Statistics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver (UBC) on various
data science-y projects, and in the special projects team at SAP Business
Objects on tools for interactive data analysis and decision making for
non-expert users.

As a graduate student, I worked at the intersection of software engineering,
human-computer interaction, and computer-supported collaborative work. For my
PhD, I created Hipikat, a system that assists software developers by integrating
and recommending information from their project's code and communication
artifacts.
