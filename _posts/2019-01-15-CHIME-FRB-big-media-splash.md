title: CHIME/FRB's big media splash
---
Today's Nature articles and our coming out party / press conference at [AAS] seems
like a good opportunity to restart this blog with an article about FRBs.

Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are cosmic radio bursts that last only milliseconds.
Based on the characteristics of the signal, we are pretty certain they come
outside the galaxy. Their brightness and short duration also indicate that they
are extremely energetic. There are [many theories][frb-theory] about their
origins (please don't take the "alien warp drive exhaust" one seriously), but
it's clear that at least one of FRBs, FRB121102, does not involve a destructive
event because it's been observed to repeat. This allowed follow-up observation
with multiple telescopes, and it's recently been [localized] to a small galaxy 3
billion light-years away, with several indicators pointing to its origin in an
extremely magnetic environment, like a neutron star or the neighbourhood of a
black hole.

Anyways, CHIME large collecting area, wide bandwidth, and high processing speed
mean that it's ideally suited to scanning the sky for FRBs. This promise has
turned out to be correct, as we have now unveiled thirteen new FRBs that we
detected late last summer in our "warmup" stage. Most excitingly, one of these
has been found to repeat, only [the second repeater][FRB180814] to date. These
findings set the stage for a flood of new FRBs, and -- eventually -- sufficient
data to where their origin can be understood fairly well and used to further
expand our knowledge about the universe.

Incidentally, last week was the second anniversary of my joining the project.
It's certainly been a thrilling ride -- from the excitement at being a part of
such a big project, to having to absorb enough of concepts about astronomy /
interferometry / DSP to be able to converse with my colleagues, but also the
pure enjoyment of learning and really using a while bunch of new technologies
and skills: Python, Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring, C++, distributed
systems. Even my regular Unix sysadmin skills had to immprove: picking up
Ansible for uniform, automated configuration management; configuring network
switches; even my Bash-fu has gone up significantly, forced as I've been to use
it as a _scripting_ tool more than an interactive terminal prompt. All in all,
not a bad start to the year! It's promising to be a good one, with plenty more
excitement ahead: from improving our monitoring to expanding automation in the
analysis pipeline to deal with the data flood promised by our commissioning
phase. Exciting times ahead!
